How Copilot Assisted in Debugging and Enhancing the User Management API
Microsoft Copilot played a crucial role in improving the User Management API by identifying and resolving key issues.

Debugging Assistance:

Suggested fixes for missing namespace imports (Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc) that caused errors in the controller.
Identified the need for proper validation in POST and PUT methods to prevent invalid user data.
Recommended structured error handling using try-catch blocks to prevent application crashes.
Middleware Implementation:

Helped in creating middleware for error handling, ensuring consistent responses for unhandled exceptions.
Assisted in setting up authentication middleware, allowing only requests with valid tokens.
Generated logging middleware to track incoming requests and outgoing responses for auditing.
Code Optimization & Best Practices:

Suggested improvements to API endpoint structure for better readability and maintainability.
Ensured the correct middleware pipeline order for optimal performance.
Improved performance of the GET endpoint by handling potential null values efficiently.
By leveraging Copilot, the API is now more secure, reliable, and maintainable, aligning with best practices in back-end development.
